Throughout my life of growing up many freinds and family members have had many problems in know what healthy eating is or looks like. In todays society most teens want to look thin to feel good about themselves. Throughout school and it's health classes it provides I have been able to learn about many sicknesses like bulimia, anorexia, binge eating and more. Hopefully my this website can be impactful to my communtiy and help many change thier lives.</font></p>
